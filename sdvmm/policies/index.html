                                    <p style="padding: 16px;">This webpage was updated on September 13, 2022.<br><br>----------<br><br><strong>Telemetry Policy</strong><br><span style="color: rgb(101, 101, 101);">Stardew Valley Mod Manager</span><br><span style="color: rgb(101, 101, 101);">Copyright ©️ 2022 - RWE&nbsp;Labs, Ryan Walpole Enterprises</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">TELEMETRY OVERVIEW</span></strong><br>As of Stardew Valley Mod Manager build v220902_1309222P, compiled on September 13 2022 and any official releases after version 220901, new telemetry features were introduced into the application. These telemetry features are collected on the local device and contain statistics and information that can be useful to the developer. They are then sent periodically to RWE Labs for observation if the user has opted to do so. This policy will further explain the process, usage and storage of this data and how it will be used.<br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Collection of Data</span></strong><br>Regardless of whether the user has opted-in to telemetry data, the application will still compile a telemetric data file every time the application is closed. The application will compile a list of statistics and information that will be saved locally on the computer and will remain on the user's local PC at the following location:<br><br><code class="text-center" style="font-size: 16px;">%AppData%\Roaming\RWE Labs\SDV Mod Manager\telemetry.json</code><br><br>The file will only be collected by RWE Labs if the user has opted in to the telemetry program. The program will prompt the user to join the program the first time they launch it after updating to a version with telemetry. The user can also opt-in or opt-out at any point in the Settings.<br><br><strong>What Data Is Collected</strong><br>When closing the application, the Stardew Valley Mod Manager will collect a series of statistics and information. It is important to note that none of the information collected is identifiable information. The following anonymous information may be collected:<br><br>- The number of times the application has been opened&nbsp;<code>Integer</code><br>- The number of farm saves present on the machine&nbsp;<code>Integer</code><br>- The color profile / theme being used&nbsp;<code>String</code><br>- If the application is set to check for updates on startup&nbsp;<code>Boolean</code><br>- If the application is set to check for SMAPI updates on startup&nbsp;<code>Boolean</code><br>- The number of mods installed&nbsp;<code>Integer</code><br>- The number of mods that are enabled&nbsp;<code>Integer</code><br>- The number of mods that are disabled&nbsp;<code>Integer</code><br><br>There may also be other statistics being collected at a later date, all of which can be viewed in the telemetry file at the forementioned device's local storage location.<br><br><strong>How The Data is Stored and Used</strong><br>If the user has opted in to share the telemetry file with RWE Labs, occasionally the application will send the telemetry file to RWE Labs via FTP (File Transfer Protocol). In the background, the application will connect securely to a file server and upload the file (like uploading a file to a webite). This file will then be stored on RWE Labs servers. The file will be named "dd-mm-yy-hh-mm-ss_telemetry.json" and will not be named or include information about the PC uploading the file (or the network, like IP address and country).<br><br>The data will be observed and used by RWE Labs from a secure sandbox environment, where the statistics will be used to frame a picture of how users are using the Stardew Valley Mod Manager. RWE Labs might, for example, see that most users are only installing 3 or 4 mods and therefore can consider design decisions based around this (like some more spacing between items in the mods list) etc.<br><br><strong>Opting In and Out of Sharing Telemetry</strong><br>When the user opens Stardew Valley Mod Manager for the first time since updating to a version with telemetry included, the user will be prompted with a new window asking if they wish to opt-in to sharing the telemetric data. This window will also show the user an example of what information is being shared with RWE Labs, if they choose to opt in as well as a link to this policy. The user can select "Allow" or "Deny" to opt in or out.<br><br>Once the user has opted in or out, they will need to manually change a setting if they wish to opt-out or in. To do so, the user can click "Settings" in the bottom right of the application, scroll to "Telemetry" and click "Opt-In" or "Opt-Out" depending on the current status of the telemetry program for the user.<br><br><strong>How often is Telemetry shared?</strong><br>If the user is opted in, the telemetric data will be shared occasionally based on how often the application is used. If the application is used heavily, telemetric data might be shared more often. Generally the application is designed to share information with RWE Labs once a week.<br>Telemetry is also only shared if the application is being used. If the user stops using the program, telemetric data will not be sent. Telemetry is only shared with RWE Labs when the application is opened.</p>

There do exist built in analytics however that may group you into a larger number of statistics (e.g 40% of users have an IP address from Australia) of which you may be included. Your IP address, Browser and date visited are included as a part of this information.
